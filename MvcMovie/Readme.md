## Overview
This web application is a database. This is a fully functional Model, View, Controller framework
that is using the .NET core and the Entity-database-Framework. A majority of this application is

in controllers using Post Put Methods. The Controller then sends for the Post/Put methods to 
retrieve the razor pages.
